    <h2>Short Info</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently a third year bachelor student in mathematics and computer
      science at
      <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">École Polytechnique</a>. I'm also
      a part-time assistant coach and problemsetter for the
      <a href="https://thailandoi-org.vercel.app">
        Thailand team to compete in the International Olympiad in Informatics</a
      >. I enjoy studying mathematics and solving algorithmic problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
    Since I'm in the Bachelor level, my academic interests will be quite wide
    but not really deep. I'm interested in (last updated Sep 11, 2023):
    <ul>
      <li>Group theory</li>
      <li>Galois theory</li>
      <li>Algebraic topology</li>
      <li>Algebraic geometry</li>
      <li>Arithmetic geometry</li>
      <li>Number theory</li>
      <li>Complexity theory</li>
      <li>Graph algorithms</li>
      <li>Computer architecture</li>
      <li>Cryptography</li>
      <li>Combinatorics</li>
      <li>Philosophy of science, mathematics, politics and moral</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
    <p>
      I started doing competitive programming back in 2015, where I learned the
      basics of C/C++. With a moderate amount of practice, I was able to join
      the regional training camp at Silpakorn University in 2016 and then I
      participated the Thailand Olympiad in Informatics (TOI) in 2017, receiving
      a gold medal. After that, I tried, failed, and tried again, in the
      national level, until I was selected as the top four of Thailand. I then
      competed in IOI2019 and IOI2020, receiving two bronze medals.
    </p>
    <p>
      One important thing that I want to declare is that: all these practice
      sessions, all these trainings, all these pains and joys, they're not
      meaningless! Even at this point where I'm too old to do IOI, I still
      embrace those moments as an important part of my life! This is why I'm
      still a competitive programmer and I'm very proud of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm still an active competitive programmer, training to compete
      in SWERC/ICPC as a part of the École Polytechnique team. Apart from that,
      I'm also an assistant coach and problemsetter for the Thailand team
      selection to compete in the IOI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mini book that I wrote (in Thai):
      <a
        href="https://github.com/plumsirawit/101-for-ioi/releases/tag/v0.1.1-alpha"
        >101 for IOI</a
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Why do I choose to study Math/CS?</h2>
    <p>
      Before answering that question, let me declare that my view towards
      mathematics is aligned to
      <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/"
        >mathematical platonism</a
      >. This is in contrast to some of my friends' views that mathematics is
      constructed by humans, or that mathematics is just a convenient tool to
      solve problems. For me, it is more that just a construction or a tool.
      Mathematics is a realm of unknowns and their connections. The study of
      mathematics deserves its own purpose, independent of technological
      advances and independent of applications. However, this doesn't restrict
      my goals to studying only the <b>pure</b> mathematics. Sometimes I also
      study mathematics for its applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can characterize my "reason to study" as a combination of simply two
      things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I solve problems because they are fun to think about. It's like a puzzle
        game where I can spend time thinking on solutions to the puzzle. This is
        the same reason as why I like to play puzzle games, and this is more
        CS-oriented.
      </li>
      <li>
        I study deeper mathematics because I want to uncover the underlying
        truth. I want to know more about something that I don't know. It's fun
        when I learn something I don't understand before. This is the reason why
        I study topics in pure math.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Seeing open problems and conjectures, these two motivations push me
      forward to think about things and to go try solving them for fun (even if
      I almost always failed).
    </p>
    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      Before coming to study in France, right after finishing high school at
      <a href="https://www.mwit.ac.th/html/">Mahidol Wittayanusorn School</a>, I
      was a software engineering intern, and then a full-time software engineer
      at <a href="https://www.brikl.com/">Brikl</a> for a few months. I mostly
      developed websites using React and handled 3D interactions using ThreeJS
      and Fabric.js. I did a little bit on SVG and file processing. Before that,
      I started my hobby from developing multiple programming judges/graders
      such as Fossil Grader and Cafe Grader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sample projects: <a href="https://pdf.graders.me/">task-pdf-writer</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/plumsirawit/cafe-grader-docker/"
        >Dockerized Cafe Grader</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      I play computer games. Mostly puzzle, rhythm, and indie games. Sometimes I
      play FPS, MOBA or MMORPG also. I play the piano (basic) and the guitar
      (also basic). I play badminton and table tennis (and do a little bit of
      running, sometimes). I also watch volleyball sometimes.
    </p>
